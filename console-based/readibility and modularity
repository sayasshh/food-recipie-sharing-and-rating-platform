The code is designed to be modular by separating concerns into different classes:

Recipe handles the recipe data.
RecipeService manages the core recipe logic (adding, updating, deleting, listing).
RecipeApp is responsible for user interaction and managing the application flow.
Additionally, methods like listAllRecipes(), addNewRecipe(), updateRecipe(), and deleteRecipe() are responsible for specific tasks, keeping the RecipeApp class clean and easy to read.
